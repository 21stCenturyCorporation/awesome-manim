Thank you for your interest in contributing.


Contributing can be confusing, so here are a guide:
---------------------------------------------------
#. Install git:

   For intructions see https://git-scm.com/.
   
#. Fork the project. Go to https://github.com/ManimCommunity/awesome-manim and click the "fork" button to create a copy of the repository for you to work on. You will also need a Github account.

#. Clone your fork to your local computer:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/awesome-manim.git
   
   .. WARNING::
      Do not clone the ManimCommunity/awesome-manim repository. You must clone your own fork.

#. Change the directory to enter the project folder:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
      cd awesome-manim

#. Do your alterations and then commit and push then:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
      git add <your-files>
      git commit -m "<message>"
      git push

#. Now you go to your github repository page and create a pull request.

#. Someone will check and accept or not your contribution
